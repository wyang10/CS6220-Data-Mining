# HeartAttack

This project analyzes under the situation of the Heart Attack Patients discharged from the hospitals, if demographics factors and the hospital codes are given, could the researcher and the medical personnel forecast the mortality of this patients. To answer this question, we compared the performance of six classification models with Python and R packages, using the data of Heart Attack Patients from all of the hospitals in New York State in 1993, including sex, age, diagnosis and length of stay. These pipeline workflows start with ingesting the raw data, preprocessing, training, predicting, visualizing, analyzing, and interpreting the findings. Our result shows that the performance of decision trees model is the best among these classification models. Results also revealed that given the sample groups in the training dataset are unbalanced (9:91), some predictive results from the models might lose their validations. From a safety perspective, we suggest relative personnel should use SMOTE algorithm (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to equalize the samples groups before traning the data.
